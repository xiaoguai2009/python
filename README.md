Write a program that prints a line with the message “Hello world!”.
Input
There is not input: the program does not read anything.
Output
Print exactly the required text in a line.
Observation
This problem is atypical, because we do not need to read any input, and we always have to
print the same. It is very easy!
Sample input 1
Input does not matter.
Sample output 1
Hello world!
Sample input 2
Really: Input does not matter!
Sample output 2
Hello world!
